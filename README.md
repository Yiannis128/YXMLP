# YXMLP
This is a wrapper for the Java DOM XML. It allows for the creation and manipulation of XML files at an easier and more abstract level than what is originally available.

This is similar to C# implementation.

Classes:
1. XmlParser - This class contains IO methods.
2. XmlElement - This class encapsulates behavior of an element. It can be assigned a name, children and attributes.
3. XmlAttribute - This class encapsulates an attribute, it can be named and given a value.

Using these 3 classes allows the creation and manipulation of a wide range of XML files.
