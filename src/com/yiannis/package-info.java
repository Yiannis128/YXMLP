/**
 * This is a package that contains classes that make reading XML files easier.
 * The way methods work is inspired from C# library, however the project does not
 * use any source code from the C# implementation, instead it acts more like a
 * wrapper to the DOM model that is already present in Java. To the outside viewer,
 * it looks and functions exactly as the C# XmlDocument.
